I enjoy my Winix air purifier so much. I purchased the air purifier from Costco and was intimidated at first, but upon opening it I found that the desisgn was very simple. The Winix air purifier has 4 buttons on it and was very **learnable** without reading the instructions. 

The Winix has one power button, two buttons that control that power of the air purifier, and one button for wireless connection. The simple design is very easy to understand and the **metaphors** used make it easy to understand. The power button has the universal symbol for power and the two buttons that control power of the air purifier have arrows pointing left and right. To activate the machine you press the power button to turn it on then press the right arrow to increase the rate at which the air purifier takes in air or press the left arrow to lower the rate at which the air purifier takes in air. The results of the machine will leave you **satisfied**. It really helped clear the are in a **efficent** way when the paradise fire was happening. 

It has a very niche **utility** to me in which I have only used it when the paradise fire was going on. But the use was very **memorable**, I will often turn it on when I smell smoke or the room becomes dusty and have no problems using it. I have yet to try and use the app that Winix has to connect to it. I am sure that it has more features that propbably make it more **efficient** but I like using it manually. 

The product becomes very useful when a fire happens or smog creates a problem in the air. For example, the air purifier will be able to indicate that the air is harmful by showing a red color. Which would then indicate to the user that they should increase the amount of air the air purifier is taking in to help clean the air. 

Overall, my experice with the Winix has left me **satisfied** I would recommend this product to everyone. I appericate the plug and play style of the air purifier with really easy **learnability**.
