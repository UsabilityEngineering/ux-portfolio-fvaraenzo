The Dogtra IQ Plus+ is a fantastic dog training tool that was easy to use and helped train my over-reactive husky Enzo. The item was easy to learn and easy to remember. 

The Dogtra IQ Plus+ is a controller and collar combo used to train your dog and help teach proper behaviors. The controller features 3 buttons, a dial, and a switch. The collar features a strap around the dog and the receiver already attached. The item has very good documentation on how to use the product as well as in-depth videos on the product. The simple design really helped the **learnability** of this product. It was not exactly plug and play but the instructions and videos for visual aid really helped with learning to understand the product. The product buttons each featured a letter either being N, C, P, being shorthand for nick, constant, or pager. The labeling on the buttons really helped with the **memorability** of the product. 

The product featured a dial that was easy to learn and clearly was used to show the amount of output the collar will do upon using the device. The switch on the controller was also easy to understand as it was used to be on the proper frequency to communicate with the receiver. 

The product featured some **affordance** with the dial, as I was able to understand its possible use before reading the documentation. 

A good example of using the product was when I was training Enzo to have a better recall. We would go out on a field and I would have a mile-long leash on him and the shock collar to help with the training. I would release him and he would run and play, then I would call to him expecting him to return on command. However, since he was training he would not come as quickly as I wanted but I would use the controller to give him a nick. The nick would then let him know that he has to return right away. 

The product had high **learnability** and was simple to understand. This made the product more **efficient** to get started with training and leave me with **satisfaction**. Enzo enjoyed the collar and was **satisfied** with the product as well. The productâ€™s documentation made me feel that this product was **safe** and I highly recommend it to dog owners.
